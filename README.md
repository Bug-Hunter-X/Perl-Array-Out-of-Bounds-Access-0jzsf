This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl programming: accessing an array element beyond its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains code that attempts to access an element that does not exist within the array. This will result in an error. The `bugSolution.pl` file provides a solution that addresses this issue by first checking whether the index is valid before accessing the array element.
